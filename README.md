# sprint i-o

## Introduction

This is an application for people who want to handle their sprints, having an idea of the work progression and allowing a better understanding of work and workflow.

### Inspiration

This application refers to the Kanban Method. It is a method for managing knowledge work which balances demands for work with the available capacity for new work. Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from task definition to customer delivery. Team members "pull" work as capacity permits, rather than work being "pushed" into the process when requested.

#### Release

This work is still in progress, I'm currently handling the access rights allowing to create an account and log to the application. We can also create a sprint and visualize it.

The next step would be to create and use the user stories.  User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.
